INSTRUCTION
=====
1. On a PC with Python (version 3) installed, install *esptool* by command:
[pip install esptool]
or from the current Git repository [pip install -r requirements.txt]

2. Connect the board to the PC via USB in boot mode (with the Btn_G0/BOOT button pressed).

3. Determine the port to which the board is connected (e.g., in Windows --> Device Manager):
[for example, our port will be COM5]

4. Use the firmware file from the current repository *m5stack_micropython.bin* and run command:
[esptool --port COM5 --baud 460800 write_flash 0 board_firmware/m5stack_micropython.bin]

where 
   (-) COM5 = board connection port (this changes!)
   (-) --baud 460800 = change data transfer rate to higher speed
   (-) write_flash 0 = command to write firmware starting from the first memory cell
   (-) board_firmware/m5stack_micropython.bin = path to the .bin firmware file

5. Wait for completion. Done, now the board is flashed with MicroPython!
(you can check it yourself in the Thonny IDE).
